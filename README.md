# New York Data Without Borders Datadive #
_This is currently a placeholder for a repository that will be populated with resources from the event, which took place October 14-16, 2011._
 
 - We are in the process of moving material from the Wiki at http://wiki.datawithoutborders.cc
 
This repository is the primary resource for all things developed during the Datadive.  It will include subdirectories for the participating social organizations, which will contain the code, data, and analyses produced by the participants.
